  <h1>Base Building Guide for Starters</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Step 1: Craft a Fence Kit</h2>
    <p>Combine <strong>2 Short Sticks</strong> and <strong>1 Rope</strong> to create a Fence Kit.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Place the Fence Kit & Add Logs</h2>
    <p>Place the Fence Kit on flat ground. Attach <strong>2 Wooden Logs</strong> and use a <em>Shovel or Pickaxe</em> to build support posts.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Build the Frames</h2>
    <p>Attach <strong>18–24 Planks</strong> and <strong>40–60 Nails</strong> to form the fence frame. Use a <em>Hammer, Hatchet, or Sledgehammer</em> to build the lower and upper frames.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Add the Gate Mechanism</h2>
    <p>Attach <strong>1 Metal Wire</strong> to the center. Equip <em>Pliers</em> and select <em>Build Gate</em> to finalize the gate.</p>

    <h2>Optional Step: Secure the Gate</h2>
    <p>You can add a <strong>Combination Lock</strong> to secure your gate.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The gate opens from only one side.</li>
      <li>Frames must be fully built before adding the gate mechanism.</li>
      <li>You can add barbed wire or camouflage netting after building the gate.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Placing fence kits on uneven or sloped ground — this causes build errors and instability.</li>
      <li>Trying to add the gate mechanism before building both the lower and upper fence frames.</li>
      <li>Not having enough nails or planks before starting — gather more to avoid interruption.</li>
      <li>Forgetting to attach support posts (using shovel or pickaxe) — these keep your fence stable.</li>
      <li>Leaving gates unlocked or unprotected — always add a combination lock if possible.</li>
      <li>Building too close to other player bases — might cause conflict or block your own expansions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Do I Repair My Fence Gate?</h2>
    <p>Use a <strong>Hammer</strong> or <strong>Hatchet</strong> with nails to repair damaged fence parts. Regularly check for damage after fights or bad weather.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Can I Move or Dismantle a Built Fence?</h2>
    <p>Once built, fences cannot be picked up or moved. You will need to dismantle parts individually or build a new fence elsewhere.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Materials Are Best for Base Defense?</h2>
    <p>Wooden fences provide basic protection, but combining them with <strong>barbed wire</strong> and <strong>camouflage netting</strong> greatly improves defense. Metal fences offer stronger resistance but require more resources.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Do I Upgrade My Base Over Time?</h2>
    <p>Start with basic fences and gates, then add reinforcements like metal panels, traps, and locks. Keep upgrading materials and adding layers for better security.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Do Fences Work in Multiplayer?</h2>
    <p>Friends and trusted players can open your gates if you share the combination lock code. Enemies cannot open locked gates, so always secure your base.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Common Traps or PvP Tactics Should I Watch Out For?</h2>
    <p>Beware of enemy players sneaking through unlocked gates or placing explosives near your base. Use watchpoints and keep your base well-lit and guarded.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How to Camouflage Your Base Effectively?</h2>
    <p>Use natural foliage, camouflage netting, and build near trees or terrain features to blend your base into the environment and avoid detection.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Do Weather and Decay Affect Base Building?</h2>
    <p>Weather can damage your fence over time. Regularly repair and maintain your base to prevent decay and keep it strong against the elements.</p>
